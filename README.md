# Project-Google
first project create a google web page
recreate the google search homepage and use the web dev tools.
The page must look similar doesn't have to all function
i dont know how to make the "i'm feeling lucky " button with varying outcomes 
The web dev tools was very useful in finding out the html and associated css
